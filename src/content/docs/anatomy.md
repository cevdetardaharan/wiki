- `cerata` are elongations from the body
- They are organized into `clusters`
- They end with `sac`s that store `venom`
- Each `sac` has multiple `cysts` inside

- The `skeleton` is the fluid in the body that keeps glaucus in shape
- The `bubble` helps glaucus stay afloat and maintain bouyancy

- glaucus `swallow`s venomous animals (e.g. Portuguese Man O War) using its radula (mouth)
- It creates a much concentrated `venom` and stores it in the `sac`s

## Naming Convention
- The packages represent the `cerata`
- The package repositories represent the `clusters`
- Staging directories `DESTDIR`s represent the `sac`s

- The base/core group represents the `skeleton`
- The live system represents the `bubble`

- The package manager `rad` represents the radula and its utilities represent the `teeth`
- Fetching source tarballs is called `swallow`
- Building from source is called `envenomate`

- Package conflicts: sting?
- Extract venom to rootfs: discharge

## Excluded
- foot
- tail
- uncoil
