- `cerata` are elongations from the body
- They are organized into `clusters`
- They end with `sac`s that store `venom`
- Each sac has multiple `cysts` inside

- The `skeleton` is the fluid in their bodies that keeps them in shape
- The `bubble` helps the animal stay afloat and maintain bouyancy

- glaucus `swallows` venomous animals (e.g. Portuguese Man O War) using its `radula` (mouth)
- It creates a much powerful concentrated `venom` and stores it in the `sac`s

## Naming Convention
- The packages represent the `cerata`
- The package repositories represent the `clusters`
- Staging directories `DESTDIR`s represent the `sac`s

- The base/core group represents the `skeleton`
- The live system represents the `bubble`

- The package manager represents the `radula` and its utilities represent the `teeth`
- The process of fetching source tarballs is called `swallow`
- The process of building from source is called `envenomate`

- Package conflicts: sting?
- Extract venoms to rootfs: discharge?

## Excluded
- foot
- tail
- uncoil
